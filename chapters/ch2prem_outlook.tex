\ctparttext{
  This part is dedicated to a subjective perspective on how the research line of this thesis can or should be extended.
  In this thesis, we sought for \emph{principled} ways of approaching the brain.
  Although this thesis touched on various such aspects,
  but I believe it misses an important aspect of the brain which is its \emph{adaptivity}.
  In the end, brain, presumably the most ``complex system'', needs to survive in the environment.
  Indeed, in the field of \emph{complex adaptive systems}, the endeavor is understanding very similar 
  questions in the nature.
  Inspired by some ideas discussed in the field of complex adaptive systems,
  we suggest a set of new research directions that intend to incorporate the adaptivity aspect of the brain as one of the principles. 
  Of course, these research directions, remain close to the neuroscience side, similar to the intention of the research presented in previous parts.
